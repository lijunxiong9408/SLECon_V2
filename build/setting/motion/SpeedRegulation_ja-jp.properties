Description_OverSpeedThreshold = <html>Speed threshold of over-speed. This value is the absolute speed of the car cabin. Unit in millimeter per second (mm/s).
Description_OverSpeedTimeLimit = <html>Hold-off time before over-speed triggered. Unit in millisecond (ms).
Description_SpeedLossThreshold = <html>Speed threshold of speed-loss. This value is the relative speed of the car cabin to the speed setpoint value. Unit in millimeter per second (mm/s).
Description_SpeedLossTimeLimit = <html>Hold-off time before speed-loss triggered. Unit in millisecond (ms).
Description_AccelerationSpeedLossThreshold = <html>Speed threshold of speed-loss during acceleration. This value is the relative speed of the car cabin to the speed setpoint value. Unit in millimeter per second (mm/s).
Description_AccelerationSpeedLossTimeLimit = <html>Hold-off time before speed-loss during acceleration triggered. Unit in millisecond (ms).
Description_UslLslOverSpeedThreshold = <html>Speed threshold of over-speed when car cabin enter USL/LSL. Force deceleration will be triggered when the absolute speed of the car higher than this value. Unit in millimeter per second (mm/s).
Description_SpeedCheckUpperThreshold = <html>Upper threshold speed of speed check signal. Unit in millimeter per second (mm/s).
Description_SpeedCheckLowerThreshold = <html>Lower threshold speed of speed check signal. Unit in millimeter per second (mm/s).
Description_ReferenceSpeedAnalogOutputOffset = <html>Offset value of the speed setpoint (reference speed) analog output signal relative to ground. Useful when analog ground is noisy by shifting the zero-speed value to higher voltage.
