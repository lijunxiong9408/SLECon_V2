Description_RevolutionPerMinuteRpm = <html>Number of revolution per minute of the motor main shaft at maximum speed.  Uint in mm.
Description_MaximumLinearSpeedMmS = <html>The maximum designed linear speed of the car cabin. Uint in mm/s.
Description_EncoderCountPerRevolutionCpr = <html>Number of encoder count per revolution of motor main shaft.
Description_InvertPhase = <html>Check this option to invert the direction of input signal of the encoder. 
Description_EncoderCprAtMaximumSpeed = <html>This is the number of count the encoder generate at maximum linear speed of the elevator. Too low (<5,000) may lead to poor control accuracy while too high (>1,500,000) may lead to unexpected result.
Description_CountToMmRatio = <html>The ratio between 1 encoder count to 1 millimeter linear displacement.
Description_RecommendedShaftLimitLslUslLength = <html>This is a recommended value of the length of shaft limit sensor. This value depends on the maximum linear speed. The actual reading of this value can be check at Installation - Shaft after self-learn door zone executed. Uint in mm.
