Description_ShaftLimitOverSpeedHoldOff = Hold-off time before over-speed in shaft limit zone triggered. Unit in millisecond (ms).
Description_BadUslLslHoldOff = Hold-off time before bad shaft-limit signal triggered. The bad signal is detected when both USL and LSL become in-active. Unit in millisecond (ms).
Description_BrakeJamTimeLimit = The time limit of Brake feedback (BS) active during car run. Unit in second.
Description_CarRunOverTime = <html>Time limit of single car run. Set this value base on time taken for the car to travel non-stop from bottom to top. Unit in second (s).
Description_UdzLdzToggleTimeout = <html>Time-out limit of UDZ/LDZ not toggling. Useful to detect car cabin movement blocking. Set this value based on the longest door zone distance travel time. Unit in millisecond (ms).
Description_DriverEnableFaultHoldoff = <html>Time-out limit of Driver enable (DRVEN) signal missing during Motor driver enabled. Unit in millisecond (ms).
Description_BrakeJamTimeRatio = <html>The time ratio of Brake feedback (BS) opened to closed during car run. When the ratio is higher than this setting, the system will become passive in order to prevent damage to the brake. Value range from 0 to 100.
Description_IdleStableDelay = <html>Hold-off time before system go to Idle state after car run and all safety signal are good. Uint in millisecond (ms).
Description_EmergencyStopHoldoff = <html>System hold-off time after Emergency stop. Useful to prevent accident operation done to the system after Emergency stop. Unit in millisecond (ms).
Description_ExitDcsInspectionHoldoff = <html>Hold-off time required to keep safety chain open (keep hall door open) after exit from DCS Inspection (cabin-top inspection). Unit in millisecond (ms).
Description_SafetyChainGoodDelay = <html>Hold-off time before safety chain consider as in good state. Unit in millisecond (ms).
